**So Luca** got an electronic piano for Christmas. It's a lovely present and he was all over it in an instant. Unfortunately it has 2 flaws designed in that will in all probability preventing him getting the practise he needs to becoming a competent pianist. Who can I blame? Well, the designer of course, who quite probably is not a parent.

As with a lot of digital products the interface is obscure. A series of multi-functional buttons hide access to its hundreds, if not thousands of instruments, effects, beats and rhythms. I can live with that, I can well believe that in 5 Christmases from now we will stumble upon something that will make us say, cool I did not know it did that!

On the left-hand side of the piano there is a big yellow button. It is the one button with a clear purpose. It is the on/off switch. If that's all it did then happy days, but no happy days. Every time the piano springs into action it starts at maximum volume. This is the first flaw.

Well, I admit it depends on your perspective. For a 2 year old a louder piano is a better piano. Why would you want to make things quieter daddy?

Infants are stubbornly unidirectional in this respect, louder, louder, louder. As a growing being presumably making things quieter would be seen as growing the wrong way.

As an already grown being I want to protect my quiet space, but I am wary that I need to give him a chance to prove himself. The minimum viable volume (MVV) feels like a fair compromise, I still want the kid to have fun after all.

But wait, where did the designer choose to put the volume control? Right next door to the big yellow on/off switch of course. This is the second flaw, which actually shouldn't even be a flaw because the machine shouldn't even start at max volume.

Now Luca is no observational slouch nor is he oblivious to cause and affect.

Luca: piano on

Me: volume down

Luca: piano off, piano on

Me: volume down

Luca: piano off, piano on

Me: volume down

Luca: piano off, piano on

..

My not so subtle interventions are not helped by the audible feedback the designer thought necessary for the machine to emit during the 10 steps from loud to quiet. It is as if the designer actually built in a security system to alert the child to the actions of a misguided adult.

A car does not start at 70 mph, a kettle does not start at 100C, so just why should a piano start at maximum volume?
